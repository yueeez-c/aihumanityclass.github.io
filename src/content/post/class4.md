## Schedule

**Due Sunday, 11:59pm**: [Project Team Form](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/161890/quizzes/162435) (assigned in Canvas) to submit your ideal project teammates and topic idea. Everyone should submit this &mdash; if you have not formed a team or identified a topic yet that is fine, but you should still submit the form, and we will use these to assemble project teams.

Check the [Team Schedule](/schedule) to be sure you know your Table Team's upcoming responbilities, and [Readings for Next Week](/readings-for-week-3). In the likely event of a snow day next week, we'll adjust the schedule, but for now assume we'll have class normally on Tuesday.
