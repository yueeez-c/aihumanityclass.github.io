### Updates

- Blog posts for [Class 8 (Interpretability)](/blogs/class8) and [Class 9 (Extractability)](/blogs/class9) are now posted.

### Reading for Tuesday, 24 February and Thursday, 26 Feburary

- Dari Amodei. [_The Adolescence of Technology
Confronting and Overcoming the Risks of Powerful AI_](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology). January 2026.

This essay is intended as a follow-up to Amodei's _Machines of Loving Grace_ essay we discussed in [Class 3](/blogs/class3/). It is the only required reading for next week. It is quite long and covers a lot of ideas, so we will split it over the two classes next week.

### (Recap from Earlier) Readings for Thursday, 19 February

- Jessica Ji, Jenny Jun, Maggie Wu, and Rebecca Gelles. [_Cybersecurity Risks of AI-Generated Code_](docs/CSET-Cybersecurity-Risks-of-AI-Generated-Code.pdf). CSET Report, November 2024. This is a long report and you are not expected to read the full report, but you should skim it to see what it covers, and pick sections that you think are interesting to read in more details.
