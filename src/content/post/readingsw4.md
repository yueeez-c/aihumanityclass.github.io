## AI Bias and Interpretability

Our next main topic, which will be for the Thursday, 5 February and Tuesday, 10 February, is on biases in AI systems and how to measure and mitigate them. There is already a vast literature on this topic, and entire courses and research agendas focused on it, so we will only see a small slice of it in these two class (and may have more classes later that go in more depth or touch on other aspects).

Readings for Thursday, 5 February:

- (Expected for Everyone) Kyra Wilson and Aylin Caliskan. [_Gender, Race, and Intersectional Bias in Resume Screening via Language Model Retrieval_](/docs/wilson2024.pdf). AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES2024). [[PDF Link](/docs/wilson2024.pdf)] [[Original Source](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31748/33915)]

Some additional readings (that are not expected for everyone, but are optional, and potentially readings the Lead Team will include):

- [Chapter 3: _Classification_](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html) from Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, Arvind Narayanan. [Fairness and machine learning: Limitations and Opportunities](https://fairmlbook.org/) ("FairML book"). MIT Press, 2023. (The full book is openly available at [https://fairmlbook.org)](https://fairmlbook.org/)].) [[Chapter Link]((https://fairmlbook.org/))]

Readings for Tuesday, 12 February:

- Cynthia Rudin. [_Stop explaining black box machine learning
models for high stakes decisions and use
interpretable models instead_]. Nature Machine Intelligence, May 2019. [[PDF Link](/docs/rudin2019.pdf)] [[arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10154) (less nicely formatted, but with fixed equations)]
