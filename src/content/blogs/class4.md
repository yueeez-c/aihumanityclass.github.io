With the recent boom in large language models and artificial intelligence in general, there has been a strong investment in infrastructure to support these models and their future iterations. One of the leading components of this infrastructure are data centers--large unassuming buildings housing thousands of powerful computers running vital processing for not just AI, but other infrastructure like networking, cloud computing, and more. 

With the spread of these large data centers has come waves of opposition, especially in our beloved state of Virginia, which is home to over 500 of them. One big reason for this pushback is speculation around the actual benefits data centers are providing to nearby residents compared to their drawbacks. The Piedmond Environmental Council, for example, says ["it is complete chaos in terms of planning for the energy infrastructure"](https://www.vpm.org/generalassembly/2026-01-16/2026-data-center-bills-thomas-hb155-mcauliff-hb503-pjm-dominion-energy) in regards to data centers and their impact on the electric grid. While data centers increase electric traffic for local residents (increasing usage rates like up to an extra $18/month), they also get nearly $2 billion in tax exemptions each year, which is money that could be allocated to imapctful areas like education or welfare. 

Apart from making electricty less affordable and paying less money than what people deem to be their "fair share" of taxes, data centers are also attributed to draining vital resources like water and impacting people's daily lives through noise, environmental disruption, and even health impacts. According to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, for example, a Harvard/MIT-backed study claims that data center operation in Tucker County, West Virginia has the potential to cause nearly [$35 million in health-related damages](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/energy_and_environment/new-report-projects-up-to-35m-in-health-damages-from-expected-tucker-co-data-center/article_0e44b758-b9d7-4040-92fa-ddf7db274333.html) to the local community. Some of the reasons for this involve 71.54 tons of fine particulate matter and 58.89 tons of sulfur dioxide being released into the air, potentially causing asthma attacks and reduced lung function.

Although data centers face pushback from people on both ends of the poltical spectrum, the issue is much more nuanced. Although they consume significant amounts of electricity and have had noticable negative externalities on some local communities, there are arguments that these "bads" don't outweigh the "goods". For one, some lawmakers believe that data centers can act as a strong source of economic growth for Virginia. Additionally, although data centers currently consume more than [4% of the US's electricity consumption](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/24/what-we-know-about-energy-use-at-us-data-centers-amid-the-ai-boom/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and is projected to more than double than figure by 2030, they only consume [1% of global electricity and emit a measly 0.5% of greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.carbonbrief.org/ai-five-charts-that-put-data-centre-energy-use-and-emissions-into-context/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Some may look at these figures and argue that the benefits received from unlimited AI access in everyone's pockets, 24/7 news streaming, connectivity through social media, and more largely outweigh the consumption risks.

Overall, the question on how "good" or "bad" data centers are is a murky one at best. Nonetheless, the news team has clear predictions for where this issue will steer in the future. They believe there will be stricter regulations (zoning rules and more thorough environmental reviews), increasing development costs, increased transparency (from developers to residents), and geographic pushback. 

## Discussion Points

One question posed to the News Team was why data centers seemed to be concentrated around typically affluent areas like Loudoun County, Dallas, Chicago, and Silicon Valley. Indeed, when looking at a map of data centers around the US, we can see that these wealthy cities tend to have hundreds of data centers. One student in the class argued that data centers, apart from needing lots of bare land, need areas with skilled workers and a pre-existing tech infrastructure, something that all of these cities have in common. Another student added that maybe the fact that these areas are wealthy allow them to fund the development of data centers inside of them. Indeed, [CoreSite](https://www.coresite.com/blog/top-10-u-s-data-center-markets-and-why-they-are-hot#:~:text=As%20one%20of%20the%20most,that%20operate%20within%20the%20district.) supports the fact that the areas selected to have data centers built on top of them usually have a strong power grid/fiber-optic system in place that a data center would benefit heavily from.
